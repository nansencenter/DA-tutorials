    "  (one conventionally \"estimates\" fixed effects and \"predicts\" random effects).\n",

    "  For example, the additional randomness (i.e., in the estimand $x$ as well as in the observations $\\vect{y}$)\n",

    "  This seems contrary to the classical BLUE framing,\n",

    "  once solved for, they are easily re-applied for different values of $\\vect{y}$.\n",
    "  However, if we shift the parentheses (and computational order) onto the first two factors,\n",
    "  then the linear solver computes $\\vect{v} = \\mat{A}_\\vect{y}^{-1} \\vect{y}$,\n",
    "  fitting $N$ RBFs to $N$ data points, $\\vect{y}$.\n",
    "  Now the \"weights\", $\\vect{v}$, are computed from the observations,\n",
    "  but applied onto $\\vect{b}_{\\vect{y} x}$, which is a function of (the location) of $x$.\n",
    "  As such we have not merely derived an estimate for a single location, $s$,\n",
    "  but an *interpolant* (that is cheap to evaluate) for all locations.\n",

    "  More rigorously, by identifying the variogram with a kernel,\n",
    "  we can appeal to the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to kriging.\n",

    "  – even though we're only solving for $N$ weights, $\\vect{v}$ –\n",
