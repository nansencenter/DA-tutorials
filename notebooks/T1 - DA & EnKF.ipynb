More sophisticated systems can also include acceleration and/or angular quantities. The *dynamical model* then consists of the fact that displacement is the time integral of the velocity, while the velocity is the integral of acceleration. The noisy *observations* can come from altimetry, sextants, speedometers, compass readings, accelerometers, gyroscopes, or fuel-gauges. The essential point is that we have an *observational model* predicting the observations from the state. For example, the altimeter model is simply the function that selects the $z$ coordinate from the state vector, while the force experienced by an accelerometer can be modelled by Newton's second law of motion, $F = m a$.\n",
