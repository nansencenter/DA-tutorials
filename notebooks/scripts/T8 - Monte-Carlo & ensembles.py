# wherein the dynamics (and measurements) are assumed linear,
# i.e. $\DynMod, \ObsMod$ are matrices.
# Furthermore, two different forms were derived,
# whose efficiency depends on the relative size of the covariance matrices involved.
# But [T6](T6%20-%20Chaos%20%26%20Lorenz%20[optional].ipynb)
# illustrated several *non-linear* dynamical systems
# that we would like to be able track (estimate).
# The classical approach to handle non-linearity
# is called the *extended* KF (**EKF**), and its "derivation" is straightforward:
# replace $\DynMod \x^\ta$ by $\DynMod(\x^\ta)$,
# and $\DynMod \, \bP^\ta$ by $\frac{\partial \DynMod}{\partial \x}(\x^\ta) \, \bP^\ta$
# (the Jacobian can also be seen as the integrated TLM of [T6](T6%20-%20Chaos%20%26%20Lorenz%20[optional].ipynb#Error/perturbation-propagation))
# and do likewise for $\ObsMod$ with $\x^f$ and $\bP^f$.
# The EKF is widely used in engineering,
# but for the class of problems generally found in geoscience,
#
# - the TLM linearisation is sometimes too inaccurate (or insufficiently robust to the uncertainty),
# and the process of deriving and coding up the TLM too arduous
# (several PhD years, unless auto-differentiable frameworks have been used)
# or downright illegal (proprietary software).
# - the size of the covariances $\bP^{\tf / \ta}$ is simply too large to keep in memory,
#   as highlighted in [T7](T7%20-%20Geostats%20%26%20Kriging%20%5Boptional%5D.ipynb).
#
# Therefore, another approach is needed...
#
# # T8 - The ensemble (Monte-Carlo) approach
#
# **Monte-Carlo (M-C) methods** are a class of computational algorithms that rely on random/stochastic sampling.
# They generally trade off higher (though random!) error for lower technical complexity [<sup>[1]</sup>](#Footnote-1:).
# Examples from optimisation include randomly choosing search directions, swarms,
# evolutionary mutations, or perturbations for gradient approximation.
# But the main application area is the computation of (deterministic) integrals via sample averages,
# which is rooted in the fact that any integral can be formulated as expectations,
# combined with the law of large numbers ([LLN](T2%20-%20Gaussian%20distribution.ipynb#Probability-essentials)).
# Thus M-C methods apply to surprisingly large class of problems, including for
# example a way to [inefficiently approximate the value of $\pi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Overview).
# Indeed, many of the integrals of interest are inherently expectations,
# in particular the forecast distribution. Its [integral](T4%20-%20Time%20series%20filtering.ipynb#The-(general)-Bayesian-filtering-recursions)
# is intractable, due to the non-trivial nature of the generating process.
# However, a Monte-Carlo sample of the forecast distribution
# can be generated simply by repeated simulation of eqn. (DynMod).
# Then, the ensemble Kalman filter (**EnKF**) analysis update is obtained by replacing
# $\ObsMod \x^\tf$ and $\ObsMod \, \bP^\tf$ by the appropriate ensemble moments/statistics[<sup>2</sup>](#Footnote-2:).
# Outside of the linear-Gaussian case, this swap is an approximation,
# but the computational cost and/or accuracy may be improved compared with the EKF.
# The EnKF will be developed in full later;
# at present, our focus is on the use of a sample
# to reconstruct (estimate) the underlying distribution.
# If it is assumed Gaussian, this mostly comes down to the estimation of its covariance matrix.
#

# Note that the estimates will never be exact:
# they contain some amount of random error, a.k.a. ***sampling error***.

# \end{align}$$
# where $\Y$ is, similar to $\X$, the matrix whose columns are $\y_n - \by$ for $n=1,\ldots,N$.

# ### Estimation errors
#
# It can be shown that the above estimators for the mean and the covariance are *consistent and unbiased*[<sup>3</sup>](#Footnote-3:).
# ***Consistent*** means that the error vanishes as $N \rightarrow \infty$.
# ***Unbiased*** means that if we repeat the estimation experiment many times (but use a fixed, finite $N$),
# then the average of sampling errors will also vanish.
# Under relatively mild regularity conditions, the [absence of bias implies consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator#Bias_versus_consistency).
#
# The following computes a large number ($K$) of $\barC$ and $1/\barC$, estimated with a given ensemble size ($N$).
# Note that the true variance is $C = 1$.
# The histograms of the estimates is plotted, along with vertical lines displaying the mean values.

def var_and_precision_estimates(N=4):
    E = rnd.randn(K, N)
    estims = np.var(E, ddof=1, axis=-1)
    bins = np.linspace(0, 6, 40)

# ### Density reconstruction
#
# We have seen that a sample can be used to estimate the underlying mean and covariance.
# Indeed, it can be used to estimate any statistic (expected value) of (wrt.) the distribution.
# Another way of stating the same point is that the ensemble can be used to *reconstruct* the underlying distribution.
# Indeed, as we have repeatedly seen since T2, a Gaussian distribution can be
# described ('parametrized') only through its first two moments,
# whereupon the density can be computed through the familiar eqn. (GM).
# Another reconstruction that should be familiar to you is that of histograms.
# Of course, their step-like nature can be off-putting,
# and therefore we should also consider their continuous counterpart,
# namely kernel density estimation (KDE).
#
# These methods are illustrated in the widget below.
# Note that the sample/ensemble gets generated via `randn`,
# which samples $\NormDist(0, 1)$, and plotted as thin narrow lines.

# **Exc – A matter of taste?:**
#
# - Which approximation to the true pdf looks better to your eyes?
# - Which approximation starts with more information?  
#   What is the downside of making such assumptions?
# - What value of `bw` causes the "KDE" method to most closely
#   reproduce/recover the "Parametric" method? What about `nbins`?  
#
# Thus, an ensemble can be used to characterize uncertainty:
# either by using it to compute (estimate) *statistics* thereof, such as the mean, median,
# variance, covariance, skewness, confidence intervals, etc
# (any function of the ensemble can be seen as a "statistic"),
# or by using it to reconstruct the distribution/density from which it is sampled,
# as illustrated by the widget above.
#
# ### What about the linearisation?
#
# **Exc – The ensemble switcheroo:**
# Show that, if the covariance matrix $\bP^\tf$ is replaced by its estimate based on $\E^\tf$ then, in the linear case,
# $\ObsMod \, \bP^\tf$ equals the cross covariance estimated from $\ObsMod \, \E^\tf$ and $\E^\tf$.

# +
# show_answer('associativity')
# -
# Now, $\ObsMod \, \bP^\tf$ figures in the KF,
# but is not applicable in the non-linear (and hence non-Gaussian).
# On the other hand, the latter approach, i.e. the EnKF, is applicable.
#
# But what can be said about the way non-linearity is handled by the EnKF?
#
# - Stein ⇒ Average derivative [[Raanes (2019)](#References)] (or derivative of average) .
#   - Exc: Stein's lemma
#     - Univariate
#     - Proof
#       It is important to note that this derivation of the ensemble linearisation
#       shows that errors (from different members) cancel out,
#       and shows exactly the linearisation converges to,
#       both of which are not present in any derivation starting with Taylor-series expansions.
#     - A similar result was recognized by [[Stordal (2016)]](#References).
#
#   Formalizes view of ensemble method as a set of finite difference perturbations (with large, pseudo-random spread).
# - When recognized as preconditioned LLS regression [[Anderson (2001)](#References)], can talk about BLUE.
# - But the whole of the EnKF can be seen as LLS regression (Snyder),
#   which is perhaps not terribly surprising considering that the whole of the KF is called BLUE,
#   i.e. is LLS (but rarely spoken of as such).
#
# ## Summary
#
# Monte-Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate expectations and distributions,
# making them powerful for complex or nonlinear problems.
# Ensembles – i.i.d. samples – allow us to estimate statistics and reconstruct distributions,
# with accuracy improving as the ensemble size grows.
# Parametric assumptions (e.g. assuming Gaussianity) can be useful in approximating distributions.
# Sample mean and covariance estimators are consistent and unbiased,
# but nonlinear functions of these (like the inverse covariance) may be biased.
# Vectorized computation of ensemble statistics is both efficient and essential for practical use.
# The ensemble approach naturally handles nonlinearity by simulating the full system,
# forming the basis for methods like the EnKF.

# - ###### Footnote 1:
# <a name="Footnote-1:"></a>
#   Monte-Carlo is *easy to apply* for any domain of integration,
#   and its (pseudo) randomness means makes it robust against hard-to-foresee biases.
#   It is sometimes claimed that M-C somewhat escapes the curse of dimensionality because
#   – by the CLT or Chebyshev's inequality – the probabilistic error of the M-C approximation
#   asymptotically converges to zero at a rate proportional to $N^{-1/2}$,
#   regardless of the dimension of the integral, $\xDim$
#   (whereas the absolute error of grid-based quadrature methods converges proportional to $N^{-k/\xDim}$,
#   for some order $k$).
#   However, the "starting" coefficient of the M-C error is generally highly dependent on $\xDim$,
#   and (in high dimensions) much more important than a theoretical asymptote.
#   Finally, the low-discrepancy sequences of **quasi** M-C [[Caflisch (1998)](#References)]
#   (arguably the middle-ground between quadrature and M-C)
#   usually provide convergence at a rate of $(\log N)^\xDim / N$
#   – a good deal faster than plain M-C –
#   which should dispel any notion that randomness is somehow the secret sauce for fast convergence.
# - ###### Footnote 2:
# <a name="Footnote-2:"></a>
#   **An ensemble** is an *i.i.d.* **sample**.
#   Its "members" ("particles", "realizations", or "sample points") have supposedly been drawn ("sampled")
#   independently from the same distribution.
#   With the EnKF, these assumptions are generally tenuous, but pragmatic.
#
#   Another derivation consists in **hiding** away the non-linearity of $\ObsMod$ by augmenting the state vector with the observations.
#   We do not favor this approach pedagogically, since it makes it even less clear just what approximations are being made due to the non-linearity.
# - ###### Footnote 3:
# <a name="Footnote-3:"></a>
#   Why should $(N-1)$ and not simply $N$ be used to normalize the covariance estimate (for unbiasedness)?
#   Because the left hand side (LHS) of $\sum_n (\x_n - \mu)^2 = N (\bx - \mu)^2 + \sum_n (\x_n - \bx)^2$
#   is always larger than the RHS.
#   *PS: in practice, in DA, the use of $(N-1)$ is more of a convention than a requirement,
#   since its impact is attenuated by repeat cycling [[Raanes (2019)](#References)], as well as inflation and localisation.*
