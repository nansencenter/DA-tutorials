# The [previous tutorial](T2%20-%20Gaussian%20distribution.ipynb)
# studied the Gaussian probability density function (pdf), defined by:
#
# $$\begin{align}
# \mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) &= (2 \pi \sigma^2)^{-1/2} e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2 \sigma^2} \,,\tag{G1} \\
# \NormDist(\x \mid  \mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma})
# &=
# |2 \pi \mathbf{\Sigma}|^{-1/2} \, \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2}\|\x-\mathbf{\mu}\|^2_\mathbf{\Sigma} \Big) \,, \tag{GM}
# \end{align}$$
# which we implemented and tested alongside the uniform distribution on a particular numerical grid:

(pdf_G1, grid1d, dx,
 pdf_GM, grid2d,
 pdf_U1, bounds) = import_from_nb("T2", ("pdf_G1", "grid1d", "dx",
                                         "pdf_GM", "grid2d",
                                         "pdf_U1", "bounds"))

# This will now help illustrate:
#
# # Bayes' rule
# In the Bayesian approach, knowledge and uncertainty about the unknown ($x$)
# is quantified through probability.
# And **Bayes' rule** is how we do inference: it says how to condition/merge/assimilate/update this belief based on data/observation ($y$).
# For *continuous* "random variables", $x$ and $y$, it reads:
#
# $$\begin{align}
# p(x|y) &= \frac{p(x) \, p(y|x)}{p(y)} \,, \tag{BR} \\[1em]
# \text{i.e.} \qquad \texttt{posterior}\,\text{[pdf of $x$ given $y$]}
# \; &= \;
# \frac{\texttt{prior}\,\text{[pdf of $x$]}
# \; \times \;
# \texttt{likelihood}\,\text{[pdf of $y$ given $x$]}}
# {\texttt{normalisation}\,\text{[pdf of $y$]}} \,,
# \end{align}
# $$

# Note that, in contrast to (the frequent aim of) classical statistics,
# Bayes' rule in itself makes no attempt at producing only a single estimate
# (but the topic is briefly discussed [further below](#Exc-(optional)----optimality-of-the-mean)).
# It merely states how quantitative belief (weighted possibilities) should be updated in view of new data.

# **Exc -- Bayes' rule derivation:** Derive eqn. (BR) from the definition of [conditional pdf's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution#Conditional_continuous_distributions).

# +
# show_answer('symmetry of conditioning')
# -

# Bayes' rule, eqn. (BR), involves functions (the densities), but applies for any/all values of $x$ (and $y$).
# Thus, upon discretisation, eqn. (BR) becomes the multiplication of two arrays of values,
# followed by a normalisation (explained [below](#Exc-(optional)----BR-normalization)).
# It is hard to overstate how simple this principle is.

def Bayes_rule(prior_values, lklhd_values, dx):
    prod = prior_values * lklhd_values         # pointwise multiplication
    posterior_values = prod/(np.sum(prod)*dx)  # normalization
    return posterior_values


# #### Exc (optional) -- BR normalization
# Show that the normalization in `Bayes_rule()` amounts to (approximately) the same as dividing by $p(y)$.

# +
# show_answer('quadrature marginalisation')
# -

# In fact, since $p(y)$ is thusly implicitly known,
# we often don't bother to write it down, simplifying Bayes' rule (eqn. BR) to
# $$\begin{align}
# p(x|y) \propto p(x) \, p(y|x) \,.  \tag{BR2}
# \end{align}$$
# Actually, do we even need to care about $p(y)$ at all? All we really need to know is how much more likely some value of $x$ (or an interval around it) is compared to any other $x$.
# The normalisation is only necessary because of the *convention* that all densities integrate to $1$.
# However, for large models, we usually can only afford to evaluate $p(y|x)$ at a few points (of $x$), so that the integral for $p(y)$ can only be roughly approximated. In such settings, estimation of the normalisation factor becomes an important question too.
#
# The code below shows Bayes' rule in action, for prior $p(x) = \NormDist(x|x^f, P^f)$ and likelihood, $p(y|x) = \NormDist(y|x, R)$. The parameters of the prior are fixed at $x^f= 10$, $P^f=4^2$ (this ugly mean & variance notation is a necessary evil for later). The parameters of the likelihood are controlled through the interactive sliders.

# **Exc -- Bayes1 properties:** This exercise serves to make you acquainted with how Bayes' rule blends information.  
#  Move the sliders (use arrow keys?) to animate it, and answer the following (with the boolean checkmarks both on and off).
#  * What happens to the posterior when $R \rightarrow \infty$ ?
#  * What happens to the posterior when $R \rightarrow 0$ ?
#  * Move $y$ around. What is the posterior's location (mean/mode) when $R$ equals the prior variance?
#  * Can you say something universally valid (for any $y$ and $R$) about the height of the posterior pdf?
#  * Does the posterior scale (width) depend on $y$?  
#    *Optional*: What does this mean [information-wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_entropy#Differential_entropies_for_various_distributions)?
#  * Consider the shape (ignoring location & scale) of the posterior. Does it depend on $R$ or $y$?
#  * Can you see a shortcut to computing this posterior rather than having to do the pointwise multiplication?
#  * For the case of two uniform distributions: What happens when you move the prior and likelihood too far apart? Is the fault of the implementation, the math, or the problem statement?
#  * Play around with the grid resolution (see the cell above). What is in your opinion a "sufficient" grid resolution?

# ## With forward (observation) models
# Likelihoods are not generally as simple as the ones we saw above.
# That could be because the unknown to be estimated controls some other aspect
# of the measurement sampling distribution than merely the location.
# However, we are mainly interested in the case when the measurement is generated via some observation model.
#
# Suppose the observation, $y$, is related to the true state, $x$,
#   via some "observation (forward) model", $\ObsMod$:
#   \begin{align*}
#   y &= \ObsMod(x) + r \,, \;\; \qquad \tag{Obs}
#   \end{align*}
#   where the corrupting additive noise has law $r \sim \NormDist(0, R)$ for some variance $R>0$.
# Then the likelihood is $$p(y|x) = \NormDist(y| \ObsMod(x), R) \,. \tag{Lklhd}$$

# #### Exc (optional) -- optimality of the mean
# *If you must* pick a single point value for your estimate (for example, an action to be taken), you can **decide** on it by optimising (with respect to the estimate) the expected value of some utility/loss function [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator)].
# - For example, if the density of $X$ is symmetric,
#    and $\text{Loss}$ is convex and symmetric,
#    then $\Expect[\text{Loss}(X - \theta)]$ is minimized
#    by the mean, $\Expect[X]$, which also coincides with the median.
#    <!-- See Corollary 7.19 of Lehmann, Casella -->
# - (a) Show that, for the expected *squared* loss, $\Expect[(X - \theta)^2]$,
#   the minimum is the mean for *any distribution*.
#   *Hint: insert $0 = \,?\, - \,?$.*
# - (b) Show that linearity can replace Gaussianity in the 1st bullet point.
#   *PS: this gives rise to various optimality claims of the Kalman filter,
#   such as it being the best linear-unibased estimator (BLUE).*
#
# In summary, the intuitive idea of **considering the mean of $p(x)$ as the point estimate** has good theoretical foundations.
#
# ## Summary
# Bayesian inference quantifies uncertainty (in $x$) using the notion of probability.
# Bayes' rule says how to condition/merge/assimilate/update this belief based on data/observation ($y$).
# It is simply a re-formulation of the notion of conditional probability.
# Observation can be "inverted" using Bayes' rule,
# in the sense that all possibilities for $x$ are weighted.
# While technically simple, Bayes' rule becomes expensive to compute in high dimensions,
# but if Gaussianity can be assumed then it reduces to only 2 formulae.
