# **Bayes' rule** is the fundamental tool for inference: it tells us how to condition/merge/assimilate/update our beliefs based on data/observation ($y$).
# For *continuous* random variables $x$ and $y$, Bayes' rule reads:
# $$
# \large
# \color{red}{\overset{\mbox{Posterior}}{p(\color{black}{x|y})}} = \frac{\color{blue}{\overset{\mbox{  Prior  }}{p(\color{black}{x})}} \, \color{green}{\overset{\mbox{ Likelihood}}{p(\color{black}{y|x})}}}{\color{gray}{\underset{\mbox{Constant wrt. x}}{p(\color{black}{y})}}} \,. \tag{BR} \\[1em]

# It is hard to overstate the simplicity of Bayes' rule, eqn. (BR): it consists merely of scalar multiplication and division.
# However, our goal is to compute the function $p(x|y)$ for **all values of $x$**.
# Thus, upon discretization, eqn. (BR) becomes the multiplication of two *arrays* of values (followed by normalization):

def Bayes_rule(prior_values, lklhd_values, dx):
    prod = prior_values * lklhd_values         # pointwise multiplication
    posterior_values = prod/(np.sum(prod)*dx)  # normalization
    return posterior_values


# #### Exc (optional) ‚Äì BR normalization
#
# Show that the normalization in `Bayes_rule()` amounts to (approximately) the same as dividing by $p(y)$.

# show_answer('quadrature marginalisation')

# In fact, since $p(y)$ is implicitly known in this way,
# we often omit it, simplifying Bayes' rule (eqn. BR) to
#
# $$ p(x|y) \propto p(x) \, p(y|x) \,.  \tag{BR2} $$
#
# Do we even need to care about $p(y)$ at all? In practice, all we need to know is how much more likely one value of $x$ (or an interval around it) is compared to another.
# Normalization is only necessary because of the *convention* that all densities integrate to $1$.
# However, for large models, we can usually only afford to evaluate $p(y|x)$ at a few points (of $x$), so the integral for $p(y)$ can only be roughly approximated. In such settings, estimating the normalization factor becomes an important question too.

# ## With forward (observation) models
#
# In general, the observation $y$ is not a "direct" measurement of $x$, as above,
# but rather some transformation, i.e. function of $x$,
# which is called **observation/forward model**, $\ObsMod$.
# Examples include:
#
# - $\ObsMod(x) = x + 273$ for a thermometer reporting ¬∞C, while $x$ is the temperature in ¬∞K.
# - $\ObsMod(x) = 10 x$ for a ruler using mm, while $x$ is stored as cm.
# - $\ObsMod(x) = \log(x)$ for litmus paper (pH measurement), where $x$ is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions.
# - $\ObsMod(x) = |x|$ for bicycle speedometers (measuring rpm, i.e. Hall effect sensors).
# - $\ObsMod(x) = 2 \pi h \, x^2$ if observing inebriation (drunkenness), and the unknown, $x$, is the radius of the beer glasses.
#
# Of course, the linear and logarithmic transformations are hardly worthy of the name "model", since they merely change the scale of measurement, and so could be trivially done away with. But doing so is not necessary, and they will serve to illustrate some important points.
#
# In addition, measurement instruments always (at least for continuous variables) have limited accuracy,
# i.e. there is an **measurement noise/error** corrupting the observation. For simplicity, this noise is usually assumed *additive*, so that the observation, $y$, is related to the true state, $x$, by
# $$
# y = \ObsMod(x) + r \,, \;\; \qquad \tag{Obs}
# $$
# and $r \sim \NormDist(0, R)$ for some variance $R>0$.
# Then the likelihood is $$p(y|x) = \NormDist(y| \ObsMod(x), R) \,. \tag{Lklhd}$$

# It is important to appreciate that the likelihood, and its role in Bayes' rule, does not perform any "inversion". It simply quantifies how well each $x$ fits the data, in terms of its weighting. This approach also inherently handles the fact that multiple values of $x$ may be plausible.

# ## Linear-Gaussian Bayes' rule (1D)
#
# To address this computational difficulty, we can take a more analytical ("pen-and-paper") approach: instead of computing the full posterior, we compute only its parameters (mean and (co)variance).
# This is straightforward in the linear-Gaussian case, i.e. when $\ObsMod$ is linear (just a number). For readability, the unknown, $x$, is colored.
#

# - and a likelihood $p(y|\color{darkorange}{x}) = \NormDist(y \mid \ObsMod \color{darkorange}{x},R)$,  
# - $\implies$ posterior $
#   p(\color{darkorange}{x}|y)
#   = \NormDist(\color{darkorange}{x} \mid x^\ta, P^\ta) \,, $
#   where, in the 1-dimensional/univariate/scalar (multivariate is discussed in [T5](T5%20-%20Multivariate%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb)) case:

#     x^\ta &= P^\ta (x^\tf/P^\tf + \ObsMod y/R) \,.  \tag{6}

# #### Exc (optional) ‚Äì optimalities
#
# In contrast to orthodox statistics,
# Bayes' rule (BR) does not attempt to produce a single estimate/value of $x$.
# It merely states how to update our quantitative belief (weighted possibilities) in light of new data.
# Barring any approximations (such as using `Bayes_rule_LG1` outside the linear-Gaussian case),
# the (full) posterior will be **optimal** from the perspective of any [proper scoring rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Propriety_and_consistency).
#
# *But if you must* pick a single point value estimate $\hat{x}$
# (in order to perform a contingent action, without [robust optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_optimization)),
# you can **decide** on it by optimising (with respect to $\hat{x}$)
# the expectation (with respect to $x$) of some utility/loss function,
# i.e. $\Expect\, \text{Loss}(x - \hat{x})$.
# For instance, if the posterior pdf happens to be symmetric
# (as in the linear-Gaussian context above),
# and your loss function is convex and symmetric,
# then the mean/median will be optimal [[Lehmann & Casella (1998)](#References), Corollary 7.19].
# More specifically, for any given distribution of $x$,
# the optimal [Bayes estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator) is:
#
# - the mode if $\text{Loss}(d) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } d = 0 \\ 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
# - the median if $\text{Loss}(d) = |d|$
# - the mean if $\text{Loss}(d) = d^2$
#
# The last case (squared-error loss) is most commonly used,
# and the resulting estimator is sometimes called
# the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator.
# *Prove that the MMSE is indeed the mean of the distribution!*

# +
# show_answer('MMSE')
# -

# However, it is not generally easy to find the posterior mean, median, or mode,
# so these optimalities mainly serve to justify a preference for $x^\ta$
# in the linear-Gaussian case.

#       It is possible to drop the Gaussianity assumption and still
#       claim optimality for $x^\ta$ of eqns. (6) and (11) as
#       the best (min. variance), linear, unbiased, estimate (BLUE ... üîç).
#   </summary>
#   The result requires reformulating the prior
#   as "background" zero-mean noise onto the (non-random) $x$,
#   whose outcome was the prior mean, $x^\tf$, and whose covariance is $P^\tf$.
#   Then, by explicit augmentation (i.e. pseudo-obs: $[y, x^\tf]$) one recovers the linear regression problem
#   of the celebrated Gauss-Markov theorem, generalized by Aitken to the case of correlated noise.
#   A similar proof uses an ansatz linear in both $x^\tf$ and $y$ without concatenating them.
#   *PS: this results is also [sometimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mean_square_error#Linear_MMSE_estimator) reframed as MMSE,
#   causing confusion with the above meaning of the acronym.*
#
#   If Gaussianity is again assumed (but the perspective remains "frequentist"),
#   then one can drop the linearity requirement,
#   yielding the (uniformly) minimum-variance unbiased estimate (UMVUE),
#   as per [Lehmann-Sheff√©](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/398911), or [Cram√©r-Rao](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/596307).
#   However, the linearity imposition cannot generally be omitted [P√∂tscher & Preinerstorfer (2024)](#References).

#
# All in all, the intuitive idea of **considering the mean of $p(x)$ as the point
# estimate** has good theoretical foundations.
#
# ## Summary
#
# Bayesian inference quantifies uncertainty (in $x$) using probability.
# Bayes' rule tells us how to update this belief based on data or observation ($y$).
# It is simply a reformulation of conditional probability.
# Observation can be "inverted" using Bayes' rule,
# in the sense that all possibilities for $x$ are weighted.
# While technically simple, Bayes' rule requires many pointwise multiplications.
# But if Gaussianity can be assumed, it reduces to just two formulae.
