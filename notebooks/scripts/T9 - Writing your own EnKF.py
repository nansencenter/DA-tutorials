# This presentation follows the traditional template, presenting the EnKF as the "the Monte Carlo version of the KF
# where the state covariance is estimated by the ensemble covariance".
# It is not obvious that this postulated method should work;
# indeed, it is only justified upon inspection of its properties,
# deferred to later.

# Since we're going to focus on a single filtering cycle (at a time),
# the subscript $k$ is dropped. Moreover, <br>
# The superscript $f$ indicates that $\{\x_n\supf\}_{n=1..N}$ is the forecast (prior) ensemble.<br>
# The superscript $a$ indicates that $\{\x_n\supa\}_{n=1..N}$ is the analysis (posterior) ensemble.
# </font></mark>
#
# ### The forecast step
# Suppose $\{\x_n\supa\}_{n=1..N}$ is an iid. sample from $p(\x_{k-1} \mid \y_1,\ldots, \y_{k-1})$, which may or may not be Gaussian.
#
# The forecast step of the EnKF consists of a Monte Carlo simulation
# of the forecast dynamics for each $\x_n$:
# $$
# 	\forall n, \quad \x\supf_n = \DynMod(\x_n\supa) + \q_n  \,, \\
# $$
# where $\{\q_n\}_{n=1..N}$ are sampled iid. from $\NormDist(\bvec{0},\Q)$,
# or whatever noise model is assumed,  
# and $\DynMod$ is the model dynamics.
# The dynamics could consist of *any* function, i.e. the EnKF can be applied with nonlinear models.
#
# The ensemble, $\{\x_n\supf\}_{n=1..N}$, is then an iid. sample from the forecast pdf,
# $p(\x_k \mid \y_1,\ldots,\y_{k-1})$. This follows from the definition of the latter, so it is a relatively trivial idea and way to obtain this pdf. However, before Monte-Carlo methods were computationally feasible, the computation of the forecast pdf required computing the [Chapman-Kolmogorov equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_equation), which constituted a major hurdle for filtering methods.
#
# ### The analysis update step
# of the ensemble is given by:
# $$\begin{align}
# 	\forall n, \quad \x\supa_n &= \x_n\supf + \barK \left\{\y - \r_n - \ObsMod(\x_n\supf) \right\}
# 	\,, \\
# 	\text{or,}\quad
# 	\E\supa &=  \E\supf  + \barK \left\{\y\ones\tr - \Dobs - \ObsMod(\E\supf)  \right\} \,,
#     \tag{4}
# \end{align}
# $$
# where the "observation perturbations", $\r_n$, are sampled iid. from the observation noise model, e.g. $\NormDist(\bvec{0},\R)$,  
# and form the columns of $\Dobs$,  
# and the observation operator (again, any type of function), $\ObsMod$, is applied column-wise to $\E\supf$.
#
# The gain $\barK$ is defined by inserting the ensemble estimates for
#  * (i) $\bP\supf \bH\tr$: the cross-covariance between $\x\supf$ and $\ObsMod(\x\supf)$, and
#  * (ii) $\bH \bP\supf \bH\tr$: the covariance matrix of $\ObsMod(\x\supf)$,
#
# in the formula for $\K$, namely eqn. (K1) of [T5](T5%20-%20Multivariate%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb).
# Using the estimators from [T7](T7%20-%20Monte-Carlo%20%26%20ensembles.ipynb) yields
#
# $$\begin{align}
# 	\barK &= \X \Y\tr ( \Y \Y\tr + (N{-}1) \R )^{-1} \,, \tag{5a}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# where $\Y \in \Reals^{P \times N}$
# is the centered, *observed* ensemble
# $\Y \ceq
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     \y_1 -\by, & \ldots & \y_n -\by, & \ldots & \y_N -\by
# \end{bmatrix} \,,$ where $\y_n = \ObsMod(\x_n\supf)$.
#
# The EnKF is summarized in the animation below.

EnKF_animation()

# #### Exc -- Woodbury for the ensemble subspace
# (a) Use the Woodbury identity (C2) of [T5](T5%20-%20Multivariate%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb) to show that eqn. (5a) can also be written
# $$\begin{align}
# 	\barK &= \X ( \Y\tr \Ri \Y + (N{-}1)\I_N  )^{-1} \Y\tr \Ri \,. \tag{5b}
# \end{align}
# $$
# (b) What is the potential benefit of (5b) vs. (5a) ?

# #### Exc -- KG workings
# The above animation assumed that the observation operator is just the identity matrix, $\I$, rather than a general observation operator, $\ObsMod()$. Meanwhile, the Kalman gain used by the EnKF, eqn. (5a), is applicable for any $\ObsMod()$. On the other hand, the formula (5a) consists solely of linear algebra. Therefore it cannot perfectly represent any general (nonlinear) $\ObsMod()$. So how does it actually treat the observation operator? What meaning can we assign to the resulting updates?  
# *Hint*: consider the limit of $\R \rightarrow 0$.

# #### Exc -- EnKF nobias (a)
# Consider the ensemble averages,
#  - $\bx\supa = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \x\supa_n$, and
#  - $\bx\supf = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \x\supf_n$,
#
# and recall that the analysis step, eqn. (4), defines $\x\supa_n$ from $\x\supf_n$.
#
#
# (a) Show that, in case $\ObsMod$ is linear (the matrix $\bH$),
# $$\begin{align}
# 	\Expect \bx\supa &=  \bx\supf  + \barK \left\{\y\ones\tr - \bH\bx\supf  \right\} \,, \tag{6}
# \end{align}
# $$
# where the expectation, $\Expect$, is taken with respect to $\Dobs$ only (i.e. not the sampling of the forecast ensemble, $\E\supf$ itself).
#
# What does this mean?

# show_answer("EnKF_nobias_a")
# -

# #### Exc (optional) -- EnKF nobias (b)
# Consider the ensemble covariance matrices:
# $$\begin{align}
# \barP\supf &= \frac{1}{N-1} \X{\X}\tr \,, \tag{7a} \\\
# \barP\supa &= \frac{1}{N-1} \X\supa{\X\supa}\tr \,. \tag{7b}
# \end{align}$$
#
# Now, denote the centralized observation perturbations
# $\D \ceq
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     \r_1 -\bar{\r}, & \ldots & \r_n -\bar{\r}, & \ldots & \r_N -\bar{\r}
# \end{bmatrix} $.
# Note that $\D \ones = \bvec{0}$ and that
# $$
# \begin{align}
# 	\label{eqn:R_sample_cov_of_D}
# 	\frac{1}{N-1} \D \D\tr &= \R \,, \tag{9a} \\\
# 	\label{eqn:zero_AD_cov}
# 	\X \D\tr &= \bvec{0} \tag{9b}
# \end{align}
# $$
# is satisfied in the expected sense, i.e. by taking the expectation on the left-hand side.
# Thereby, show that
#
# $$\begin{align}
#     \Expect \, \barP\supa &= [\I_{\xDim} - \barK \bH]\barP\supf \, . \tag{10}

# ## Experimental setup
#
# Before making the EnKF, we'll set up an experiment to test it with, so that you can check if you've implemented a working method or not.
#
# To that end, we'll use the Lorenz-63 model, from [T6](T6%20-%20Chaos%20%26%20Lorenz%20[optional].ipynb). The coupled ODEs are recalled here, but with some of the parameters fixed.

    d[0] = sig*(y - x)
    d[1] = rho*x - y - x*z
    d[2] = x*y - beta*z
    return d


# -

# Next, we make the forecast model $\DynMod$ out of $\frac{d \x}{dt}$ such that $\x(t+dt) = \DynMod(\x(t),t,dt)$. We'll make use of the "4th order Runge-Kutta" integrator `rk4`.

# Notice the loop over each ensemble member. For better performance, this should be vectorized, if possible.

#  * (c). Use $N=5$, and repeat the experiments. This is quite a small ensemble size, and quite often it will yield divergence: the EnKF "definitely loses track" of the truth, typically because of strong nonlinearity in the forecast models, and underestimation (by $\barP\supa)$ of the actual errors. Repeat the experiment with different seeds until you observe in the plots that divergence has happened.
#  * (d). Implement "multiplicative inflation" to remedy the situation; this is a factor that should spread the ensemble further apart; a simple version is to inflate the perturbations. Implement it, and tune its value to try to avoid divergence.

# ## Summary
# The EnKF is a simple algorithm for data assimilation (DA),
# that is capable of handling some degree of nonlinearity and big data/problems.
# It is a consistent approximation of the Kalman filter,
# but also contains biases.
# Successful application requires tuning of some ad-hoc parameters.
