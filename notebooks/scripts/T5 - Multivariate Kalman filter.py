# While conceptually and technically simple, the sheer **amount** of computations done by `Bayes_rule` quickly becomes a difficulty in higher dimensions. This is hammered home in the following exercise.
#
# #### Exc (optional) -- Curse of dimensionality
#
#  * (a) How many point-multiplications are needed on a grid with $N$ points in $\xDim$ dimensions? Imagine an $\xDim$-dimensional cube where each side has a grid with $N$ points on it.
#    *PS: Of course, if the likelihood contains an actual model $\ObsMod(x)$ as well, its evaluations (computations) could be significantly more costly than the point-multiplications of Bayes' rule itself.*
#  * (b) Suppose we model 5 physical quantities [for example: velocity (u, v, w), pressure, and humidity fields] at each grid point/node for a discretized atmosphere of Earth. Assume the resolution is $1^\circ$ for latitude (110km), $1^\circ$ for longitude, and that we only use $3$ vertical layers. How many variables, $\xDim$, are there in total? This is the ***dimensionality*** of the unknown.
#  * (c) Suppose each variable is has a pdf represented with a grid using only $N=20$ points. How many multiplications are necessary to calculate Bayes rule (jointly) for all variables on our Earth model?

# ## Another time series problem, now multivariate
#
# Recall the AR(1) process from the previous tutorial: $x_{k+1} = \DynMod x_k + q_k$.
# - It could result from discretizing [exponential decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay):
#   $\frac{d x}{d t} = - \beta x \,,$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, and
#   adding some white noise, $\frac{d q}{d t}$.
# - Discretisation
#   - using explicit-Euler produces $\DynMod = (1 - \beta\, \Delta t)$,
#   - using implicit-Euler produces $\DynMod = 1/(1 + \beta\, \Delta t)$.
#   - such that $x_{k+1}$ equals the analytic solution requires $\DynMod = e^{- \beta\, \Delta t}$.
#   - *PS: note that the 1-st order Taylor expansion of each scheme is the same.*
# - Recall that $\{x_k\}$ became a (noisy) constant (horizontal) line when $\DynMod = 1$,
#   which makes sense since then $\beta = 0$.  
#   Similarly, a straight (sloping) line would result from
#   $\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = 0 \,.$
#
# To make matters more interesting we're now going to consider the $\xDim$-th order model:
#   $\displaystyle \frac{d^{\xDim} x}{d t^\xDim} = 0 \,.$
# - This can be rewritten as a 1-st order *vector* (i.e. coupled system of) ODE:
#   $\frac{d x_i}{d t} = x_{i+1} \,,$ and $x_{{\xDim}+1} = 0$   
#   where the subscript $i$ is now instead the *index* of the state vector element.
# - Again we include noise, $\frac{d q_i}{d t}$,
#   and damping (exponential decay), $- \beta x_i$, to each component.
# - In total, $ \frac{d x_i}{d t} = x_{i+1} - \beta x_i + \frac{d q_i}{d t} \, .$
# - Discretizing with time step $\Delta t=1$ produces
#   $ x_{k+1, i} = x_{k, i+1} + 0.9 x_{k, i} + q_{k, i}\,,$  
#   i.e. $\beta = 0.1$ or $\beta = -\log(0.9)$ depending on which scheme was used.
#
# Thus, $\x_{k+1} = \DynMod \x_k + \q_k$, with $\DynMod$ the matrix specified below.

Q = 0.01**2 * np.diag(1+np.arange(xDim))

# #### Observing system
# The above will generate a $\xDim$-dimensional time series.

# We say that the other components are **hidden**.

# ## The KF forecast step
#
# The forecast step (and its derivation) remains essentially unchanged from the [univariate case](T4%20-%20Time%20series%20filtering.ipynb#The-(univariate)-Kalman-filter-(KF)).
# The only difference is that $\DynMod$ is now a *matrix*, as well as the use of the transpose ${}^T$ in the covariance equation:
# $\begin{align}
# \x\supf_k
# &= \DynMod_{k-1} \x\supa_{k-1} \,, \tag{1a} \\\
# \bP\supf_k
# &= \DynMod_{k-1} \bP\supa_{k-1} \DynMod_{k-1}^T + \Q_{k-1} \,. \tag{1b}
# \end{align}$
#
# ## The KF analysis step
#
# It may be shown that the prior $p(\x) = \NormDist(\x \mid \x\supf,\bP\supf)$
# and likelihood $p(\y|\x) = \NormDist(\y \mid \ObsMod \x,\R)$,
# yield the posterior:
# \begin{align}
# p(\x|\y)
# &= \NormDist(\x \mid \x\supa, \bP\supa) \tag{4}
# \,,
# \end{align}
# where the posterior/analysis mean (vector) and covariance (matrix) are given by:
# \begin{align}
# 			\bP\supa &= \big(\ObsMod\tr \Ri \ObsMod + (\bP\supf)^{-1}\big)^{-1} \,, \tag{5} \\
# 			\x\supa &= \bP\supa\left[\ObsMod\tr \Ri \y + (\bP\supf)^{-1} \x\supf\right] \tag{6}Â \,,
# \end{align}
# *PS: all of the objects in the analysis equations could also be subscripted by the time index ($k$), but that seems unnecessary (since it is the same one for all of the objects involved).*

# - Show that $\U$ and $\V$ are not necessarily square, but must have the same dimensions.  
#   *Hint: in so doing, you will also show that $\B$ and $\R$ are not necessarily of equal size.*
#
# The above exercise makes it clear that the Woodbury identity may be used to compute $\bP$ by inverting matrices of the size of $\R$ rather than the size of $\B$.
# Of course, if $\R$ is bigger than $\B$, then the identity is useful the other way around.

# #### Exc -- The "Gain" form of the KF
# Now, let's go back to the KF, eqns (5) and (6). Since $\bP\supf$ and $\R$ are covariance matrices, they are symmetric-positive. In addition, we will assume that they are full-rank, making them SPD and invertible.  
#
# Define the Kalman gain by:
#  $$\begin{align}
#     \K &= \bP\supf \ObsMod\tr \big(\ObsMod \bP\supf \ObsMod\tr + \R\big)^{-1} \,. \tag{K1}
# \end{align}$$
#  * (a) Apply (C1) to eqn (5) to obtain the Kalman gain form of analysis/posterior covariance matrix:
# $$\begin{align}
#     \bP\supa &= [\I_{\xDim} - \K \ObsMod]\bP\supf \,. \tag{8}
# \end{align}$$
#
# * (b) Apply (C2)  to (5) to obtain the identity
# $$\begin{align}
#     \K &= \bP\supa \ObsMod\tr \R^{-1}  \,. \tag{K2}
# \end{align}$$
#
# * (c) Show that $\bP\supa (\bP\supf)^{-1} = [\I_{\xDim} - \K \ObsMod]$.
# * (d) Use (b) and (c) to obtain the Kalman gain form of analysis/posterior covariance
# $$\begin{align}
#      \x\supa &= \x\supf + \K\left[\y - \ObsMod \x\supf\right] \, . \tag{9}
# \end{align}$$
# Together, eqns (8) and (9) define the Kalman gain form of the KF update.
# Note that the inversion (eqn 7) involved is of the size of $\R$, while in eqn (5) it is of the size of $\bP\supf$.
#
# #### Exc -- KF implemented with gain
#
# - Implement the Kalman gain form (eqns. K1, 8, 9) of the KF in place of the precision form (eqns. 5, 6)
#   that is [implemented above](T5%20-%20Multivariate%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb#Implementation-and-illustration).  
#   
#   - *Hint: $\I_{\xDim}$ can be obtained from `np.eye` or `np.identity`.
#     But you do not actually even need it.*
#   - *Hint: To avoid scrolling back and forth, copy the text with the Kalman gain formulae and paste them above.*
#   
# - Re-run all cells, and verify that you get the same result as before
#   (inspecting the plot of the example problem, or printouts of the same numbers).
# - Replace the use of `inv` by `scipy.linalg.solve`.
#   Don't hesitate to google their documentations.

# ## Summary
# We have derived two forms of the multivariate KF analysis update step: the
# "precision matrix" form, and the "Kalman gain" form. The latter is especially
# practical when the number of observations is smaller than the length of the
# state vector. Still, the best is yet to come: the ability to handle very
# large and chaotic systems
# (which are more fun than stochastically driven signals such as above).
