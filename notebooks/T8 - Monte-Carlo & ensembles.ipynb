    "\n",
    "Monte-Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate expectations and distributions,\n",
    "making them powerful for complex or nonlinear problems.\n",
    "Ensembles – i.i.d. samples – allow us to estimate statistics and reconstruct distributions,\n",
    "with accuracy improving as the ensemble size grows.\n",
    "Parametric assumptions (e.g. assuming Gaussianity) can be useful in approximating distributions.\n",
    "Sample mean and covariance estimators are consistent and unbiased,\n",
    "but nonlinear functions of these (like the inverse covariance) may be biased.\n",
    "Vectorized computation of ensemble statistics is both efficient and essential for practical use.\n",
    "The ensemble approach naturally handles nonlinearity by simulating the full system,\n",
    "forming the basis for methods like the EnKF.\n",

    "<a name=\"Footnote-1:\"></a>\n",
    "  Monte-Carlo is *easy to apply* for any domain of integration,\n",
    "  and its (pseudo) randomness means makes it robust against hard-to-foresee biases.\n",
    "  It is sometimes claimed that M-C somewhat escapes the curse of dimensionality because\n",
    "  – by the CLT or Chebyshev's inequality – the probabilistic error of the M-C approximation\n",
    "  asymptotically converges to zero at a rate proportional to $N^{-1/2}$,\n",
    "  regardless of the dimension of the integral, $\\xDim$\n",
    "  (whereas the absolute error of grid-based quadrature methods converges proportional to $N^{-k/\\xDim}$,\n",
    "  for some order $k$).\n",
    "  However, the \"starting\" coefficient of the M-C error is generally highly dependent on $\\xDim$,\n",
    "  and (in high dimensions) much more important than a theoretical asymptote.\n",
    "  Finally, the low-discrepancy sequences of **quasi** M-C [[Caflisch (1998)](#References)]\n",
    "  (arguably the middle-ground between quadrature and M-C)\n",
    "  usually provide convergence at a rate of $(\\log N)^\\xDim / N$\n",
    "  – a good deal faster than plain M-C –\n",
    "  which should dispel any notion that randomness is somehow the secret sauce for fast convergence.\n",
    "- ###### Footnote 2:\n",
    "<a name=\"Footnote-2:\"></a>\n",
    "  **An ensemble** is an *i.i.d.* **sample**.\n",
    "  Its \"members\" (\"particles\", \"realizations\", or \"sample points\") have supposedly been drawn (\"sampled\")\n",
    "  independently from the same distribution.\n",
    "  With the EnKF, these assumptions are generally tenuous, but pragmatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Another derivation consists in **hiding** away the non-linearity of $\\ObsMod$ by augmenting the state vector with the observations.\n",
    "  We do not favor this approach pedagogically, since it makes it even less clear just what approximations are being made due to the non-linearity.\n",
    "- ###### Footnote 3:\n",
    "<a name=\"Footnote-3:\"></a>\n",
    "  Why should $(N-1)$ and not simply $N$ be used to normalize the covariance estimate (for unbiasedness)?\n",
    "  Because the left hand side (LHS) of $\\sum_n (\\x_n - \\mu)^2 = N (\\bx - \\mu)^2 + \\sum_n (\\x_n - \\bx)^2$\n",
    "  is always larger than the RHS.\n",
    "  *PS: in practice, in DA, the use of $(N-1)$ is more of a convention than a requirement,\n",
    "  since its impact is attenuated by repeat cycling [[Raanes (2019)](#References)], as well as inflation and localisation.*\n",
