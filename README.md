  (no login but can be slow to start)

### Overview

- Interactive (Jupyter notebook)
- Contains theory, code (Python), and exercises.
- Recommendation: work in pairs.
- Each tutorial takes â‰ˆ75 min.
- The tutor will circulate to assist with the exercises,  
  and summarize each section after you have worked on them.

### Instructions for working locally

You can also run these notebooks on your own (Linux/Windows/Mac) computer.
This is a bit snappier than running them online.

1. **Prerequisite**: Python==3.7.  
   If you're not a python expert:  
   1a. Install Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  
   1b. Use the [Anaconda terminal](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda)
       to run the commands below.  
   1c. (Optional) [Create & activate a new Python environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments).
       If the installation (below) fails, try doing step 1c first.

2. **Install**:  
   Run these commands in the terminal (excluding the `$` sign):  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/nansencenter/DA-tutorials.git`  
   `$ pip install -r DA-tutorials/requirements.txt`  

3. **Launch the Jupyter notebooks**:  
   `$ jupyter-notebook`  
   This will open up a page in your web browser that is a file navigator.  
   Enter the folder `DA-tutorials/notebooks`, and click on a tutorial (`T1... .ipynb`).
